## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs via Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- Use `bd dolt push`/`bd dolt pull` for remote sync
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Build & Test

_Add your build and test commands here_

Pre-commit quality gates must run in this exact order and all must pass:

1. `cargo fmt --check`
2. `cargo build`
3. `cargo check`
4. `cargo test`

CI enforces the same cargo gate order.

All tests and clippy must pass with no warnings before the task is complete.

```bash
# Example:
# npm install
# npm test
```

## Architecture Overview

sporos is a Rust rebuild of the cross-seed behavior documented in
`docs/internal`. Treat those documents as the compatibility contract for CLI
flags, config semantics, HTTP API behavior, SQLite state, torrent cache and
output filenames, matching decisions, and torrent-client side effects.

## Conventions & Patterns

### Rust design
Preserve user-visible behavior before improving internals. When behavior is
unclear, add a compatibility test from `docs/internal` before changing it.

Memory efficiency is a primary design goal. Prefer streaming filesystem walks,
bounded queues, iterators, borrowed data, and paged database reads over loading
whole torrent inventories, RSS feeds, or directory trees into memory. Avoid
clone-heavy APIs, unbounded process-global caches, and retaining parsed torrent
metafiles longer than needed.

Keep module boundaries aligned with the documented runtime layers: CLI/config,
domain models, persistence, torrent parsing, search and matching, external
integrations, torrent-client adapters, actions, HTTP API, scheduler, and
operations. Add abstractions only when they reduce real duplication or protect a
compatibility boundary.

Every feature that touches matching, injection, persistence, or public API
behavior needs focused tests. Memory-sensitive paths should include fixtures or
benchmarks that make peak allocation or resident memory regressions visible.

### Git
Only commit touched filed, when commiting commit logical changes not just
the whole workspace. Commit messages should include a title and the body
should describe the change so that a reviewer can get an understanding. The
title should be all lower case and no longer than 50 characters, the body must
use prose, avoid lists and overly explainging things, be concise.

### Release tags
When creating a tag, include a very brief changelog in the tag annotation using
one concise line per notable change item. Keep the annotation focused on the
externally meaningful behavior change, not implementation details. Do not list
docs, refactors, config renames, or internal plumbing unless they are
themselves the notable user-facing change.
